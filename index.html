      <img src="MicrowaveInOperation.gif" alt="In Operation" width="384" heigh="500">
      <p>The Control Interface is crowded with auto cook options that nobody uses.</p>
      <p>Most of the time the options are inconsistent for brands and products and thus produce unreliable results.</p>
      <h3>Part B</h3>
      <p>Common sequence of actions involve opening the door and putting in the food to be heated.</p>
      <p>And then setting the timer and waiting until its done.</p>
      <p>The microwave gives a beep sound to let the user know that their input has been registered.</p>
      <p>The timer updates to let the user know how long it will take to complete cooking.</p>
      <p>Once that is done, the microwave will beep to let the user know its done.</p>
      <p>Common mistakes of this design are all to do with auto-cook.</p>
      <p>It is very unreliable as different items and sizes of portion are not taken into account.</p>
      <img src="p1LawzeemLatif_RoughSketch.png" alt="Rough Sketch" width="600" height="300">
      <p>My rough sketch aims to simplify things.</p>
      <p>The keypad is the main focus and will have the biggest footprint in the microwave.</p>
      <p>In addition, the most important settings for me are power and sound.</p>
      <p>Sound is important because it takes accessibility into account and allows all users to know whaat they are typing in.</p>
      <p>This can also be used in the dark to input numbers accurately.</p>
